"An ActiveX control is an OLE control that is intended to be used inside a web
browesr. Likely an ActiveX control is marked Safe for Scripting and Safe for
Initialization as well as being packaged to be installed via Authenticode.

All ActiveX / OLE controls are COM objects, but not vice versa. ActiveX / COM
controls are built on COM and implement a required minimum set of interfaces in
order to operate properly within any OLE container."
